Command line is in effect the "old school" way of talking to or
instructing computers how to act.Instead of a graphical interface like
Windows for example, where you use icons to click on and a drag and
drop style to work your way to where you want to be.The command line
enables you to communicate more directly with, and in a format more
"intelligible" to, a commputer.This makes "cl"a highly effective tool
but does need specialist training or knowledge.

The ten command lines:

pwd  Tells you where you are.In what folder you're working in.

cd   Changes you into another "directory" which is what folders are
refered to as.

mv   Moves or renames a file. If you use mv 'new name' the file is
renamed, to move it you need to say where i.e mv "blah" ~/my docs

mkdir Makes a new folder. mkdir my photos  for example makes a new
directory called 'my photos'

rm  Removes/deletes a file. You can 'rm' a folder too, it just needs
a few extra bits

ls  Lists directories or files depending on what you specify. An
initial ls will show you all your folders. After you open sub folders
it will show you whats in them, and so on and so on.

touch  Creates a file in the directory that you are already in.

cat  Displays the contents of a file. cat 'my blog' will show the
the text of 'my blog'

grep  Is a "search" for files. If you grep 'Chelsea' all files that
contain the word Chelsea will be listed (lucky them).

clear Does exactly what it says on the tin. If you get your screen
all mucked up clear will start you on a nice fresh page.
